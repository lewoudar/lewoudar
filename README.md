# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Tewouda also known as "le woudar".

I'm a python developer passionate about web programming and networking. I am a lifelong student who is always looking for ways to improve my daily skills.
I like to create things, this is why I spend part of my free time contributing to open source with my projects.

Currently my field of interest is [structured concurrency](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/)
and I hope it will be widespread within a few years. If you are passing by, don't hesitate to have a look at my projects. ðŸ˜œ

Aw, I also want to mention that IMHO [Django](https://github.com/django/django) is the best web framework ever realized in the python landscape 
and [anyio](https://github.com/agronholm/anyio) is probably what you are looking for, for concurrency in python.

See you soon!
