# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Tewouda also known as "le woudar".

I'm a python developer passionate about web programming and networking. I am a lifelong student who is always looking for ways to improve my daily skills.
I like to create things, this is why I spend part of my free time contributing to open source with my projects.

Currently my field of interest is [structured concurrency](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/)
and I hope it will be widespread within a few years. If you are passing by, don't hesitate to have a look at my projects. ðŸ˜œ

For networking stuff and concurrency, [anyio](https://github.com/agronholm/anyio) is probably what you are looking for. In any case I enjoy using it.

Aw, I also want to mention that IMHO [Django](https://github.com/django/django) is the best web framework ever realized in the python landscape, though the combination [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) + [Tortoise ORM](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm) / [ormar](https://collerek.github.io/ormar/) is also sweet ðŸ˜‹.

You can follow me on other [social medias](https://linktr.ee/le_woudar) where I shared what I have learned in tech and more ðŸ˜Š

See you soon!
